## Instructions
#You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an `X`.
# Example Input -> column 2, row 3 would be entered as: 23
# Example Output:
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
# ['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇
positionn = int(position)
column = (positionn//10) -1
row = (positionn%10) -1

map[row][column] = "X"


#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
